# embedding_dimension_limit

This repository contains my reproduction of the paper [_On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21038v1), completed as the final Information Retrieval assignment for the first year of the **Data Analysis and Modelling** master’s program.

The codebase is organized into multiple Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts. Experiments were executed across several hardware configurations:

- NVIDIA T4 and P100 GPUs on Kaggle
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 on a local machine

The presentation provides an overview of the repository structure and explains how the code is intended to be used. Additional details and documentation will be added to this README soon.
